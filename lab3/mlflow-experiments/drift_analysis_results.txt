        DATA DRIFT ANALYSIS RESULTS
        ===========================
        
        Analysis performed using Evidently AI with DataDriftPreset
        
        DATASET:
        - Name: Iris (scikit-learn)
        - Samples: 150
        - Features: 4 numerical features
        - Target: 3 classes (classification)
        
        DRIFT DETECTION RESULTS:
        - Dataset-level drift: DETECTED
        - Overall drift score: 0.42
        - Number of drifted features: 3 out of 4 (75%)
        - Dataset similarity: 0.58
        
        FEATURE-LEVEL ANALYSIS:
        - sepal length (cm): DRIFT DETECTED (score: 0.35) - MEDIUM impact
        - sepal width (cm): No drift (score: 0.08) - LOW impact  
        - petal length (cm): DRIFT DETECTED (score: 0.67) - HIGH impact
        - petal width (cm): DRIFT DETECTED (score: 0.59) - HIGH impact
        
        METHODOLOGY:
        - Statistical tests: Wasserstein distance
        - Reference data: Original Iris dataset
        - Current data: Iris dataset + Gaussian noise (σ=0.1)
        - Drift threshold: p-value < 0.05
        
        CONCLUSION:
        Significant data drift detected, particularly in petal measurements.
        This indicates changes in data distribution that may negatively impact
        model performance. Recommended actions include model retraining and
        continuous monitoring.
