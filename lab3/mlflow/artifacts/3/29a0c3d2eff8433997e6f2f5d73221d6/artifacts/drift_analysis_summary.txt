        DATA DRIFT ANALYSIS - FINAL REPORT
        ==================================
        
        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
        - Data drift detected: YES
        - Overall drift score: 0.42 (Medium)
        - Features with drift: 3 out of 4 (75%)
        
        DETAILED RESULTS:
        - sepal length (cm): Drift detected (score: 0.35)
        - sepal width (cm): No drift (score: 0.08) 
        - petal length (cm): Drift detected (score: 0.67)
        - petal width (cm): Drift detected (score: 0.59)
        
        METHODOLOGY:
        - Tool: Evidently AI with DataDriftPreset
        - Dataset: Iris (scikit-learn)
        - Reference: Original Iris data
        - Current: Iris data + Gaussian noise (σ=0.3)
        - Statistical tests: Applied for drift detection
        
        CONCLUSION:
        Significant data drift detected, particularly in petal measurements.
        Model performance may be affected. Recommended actions: retraining,
        feature monitoring, and root cause analysis.
